## Fluent Python

This repository contains sample files for studying Python with the
[Fluent Python book](https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/B09WZJMMJP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_image_o00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

- [Chapter 01](https://github.com/nfo94/fluentpython/tree/main/ch01)

Obs: this is not an easy book, god damn. I'm losing it trying to understand all this stuff.
